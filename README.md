# facial-recognition
This project analyzes the moods of the person by reading the face of the person.
It uses a neural network i.e a Convolution Neural network model consisting of two layers of each pooling and CNN layers.
We all know facial emotions play a vital role in our day-to-day life. so, we need a system which is capable of recognising our facial emotions and able to act accordingly.

This project is the first step in that system.

me emotion -- ntr emotion

Here I trained the convolution neural network with kaggle facial emotion dataset. so that it learns patterns for each facial expression and able to detect facial emotions


I wrote a medium blog on this project. you can find here for quick understanding and insights.
Feel free to download, clone , fork the project.

Installation of python libraries:
keras with tensorflow as backend
OpenCV
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
DataSet:
In this project I used kaggle dataset i.e
https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/overview
we can use a kaggle API to access and download that dataset.
